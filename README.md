# Life-Sim
This project is going to be a text based life simulator

It will mainly be reading lists and selecting random events, dates and names to make it as interesting as possible.

Currently it is able to do:
⌂Randomised name and surname
⌂Randomised passive events
⌂Aging and death
⌂Political events
⌂Sexuality
⌂Marriage
⌂Children
⌂Switching between political events and actor events
⌂War
⌂Making the user decide on a random or custom game
⌂Jobs

In progress:
⌂Figure out how to add randomised ACTIVE events
⌂More detailed lives
⌂More unique lives
⌂Changing text files to a better file format

#Figure out a way to not fuck this program up while trying to solve an issue :)
