# Life-Sim
This project is a text based life simulator.
It will possibly get a gui at some stage but it is currently in development.

It will mainly be reading lists and selecting random events, dates and names to make it as interesting as possible.






This program is currently basic however it will include things which are expected in a life simulator currently at a basic level.
