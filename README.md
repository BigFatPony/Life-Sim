# Life-Sim
This project is going to be a text based life simulator

It will mainly be reading lists and selecting random events, dates and names to make it as interesting as possible


To do:

-Randomise the year and print the year each year
-Allow to user to start a year when they want to (with pressing a specific button they'll allow new random event to happen + progress in years)
-Create an aging system (if older than a specific number they die)
-Make the characters name outputted yearly 
-Figure out how to add randomised ACTIVE events
-Add passive evnts (notepad)
-Possibly add events linked with owning animals
