# Life-Sim
This project is going to be a text based life simulator

It will mainly be reading lists and selecting random events, dates and names to make it as interesting as possible.

Currently it is able to do:
⌂Randomised name and surname
⌂Randomised passive events
⌂Aging and death
⌂Political events
⌂Sexuality

In progress:
⌂Figure out how to add randomised ACTIVE events
⌂War
⌂Switching between political events and actor events
⌂Marriage
⌂Children
⌂Removing global variables
