You have been attacked by a dog
You caught the flu
You read a book
You caught a cold
You watched a bad movie with your friends
You met a new person
You missed the bus
Your car broke down
You found £10
You won the mini lottery
Your phone broke
You saw a stray dog
You watched a good movie with your friends
You went to a party
You lost a friend
